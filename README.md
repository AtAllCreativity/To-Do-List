# To-Do-List
To-do List with an option to delete the item added to the list

Project was been worked for a while but never been staged. One of my first javascript project.
I did not have the habit of staging and committing items to git with frequency.

My objectives on this project was:
 - Usage of @import for css
 - Usage of Date for Javascript.
 - Understand Array.
 - Usage of function document.createElement.
 - Usage of appendChild.
